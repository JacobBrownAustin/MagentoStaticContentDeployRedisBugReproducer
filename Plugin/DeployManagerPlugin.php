/* This class is a plugin for Magento\Deploy\Service\DeployPackage.  It intercepts the 'deploy' method.
 * We are using it to help reproduce this issue because deploy is one of the first things called from within the child process.
 * The main thing this plugin does is have redis get called over and over for 5 seconds. 
 * That way, we should have multiple children calling Credis and using the redis connection at the same time.
 * Since we already set up the redis connection in the parent process, the children should be using the parent's connection to the server which is the cause of the issue.
